## BingBong
BingBong is a 2D billiards simulation game developed in Java Swing as part of a Parallel Programming course project.
The game demonstrates real-time physics, collision detection, and multithreaded motion â€” where multiple balls move and interact simultaneously on different maps.
Players can customize the number of balls, obstacles, and maps, and experience Prediction Mode, where they try to guess which ball will fall into the hole first
The game is still in development so I will update it as soon as possible!
