## 🧩 Introduction

- BingBong is a mini 2D billiards-inspired simulation game built in Java!
Players can watch colorful balls move, bounce, and collide inside a rectangular arena while overcoming various obstacles and holes.
Each map offers a different layout and challenge — from free movement to prediction gameplay — demonstrating concepts of parallel programming and real-time physics simulation.

## 🌟 Features

- Three Unique Maps – Each with its own layout of holes, walls, and obstacles, offering new challenges every round.

- Parallel Ball Simulation – All balls move simultaneously using multithreading to simulate real-time motion and collision.

- Prediction Mode – Guess which ball will fall into the hole first. Win if you’re right!

- Dynamic Obstacles – Randomly generated walls and barriers ensure no two games are ever the same.

- Gradual Slowdown & Friction – Balls lose speed and come to rest naturally over time.

- Simple Controls & Lively Interface – Start, stop, or reset with intuitive on-screen buttons.

- Sound Effects – Realistic collision and victory sounds for an engaging experience.

## 🎮 How to Play

1 Run the game (App.java).

2 Choose a map, number of balls, and number of obstacles.

3 Press “Start” to begin the simulation — balls move, bounce, and collide in real time.

4 In Prediction Mode, guess which ball will fall into the hole first.

5 Restart or return to the main menu anytime using on-screen buttons or hotkeys.

6 Enjoy the game :))

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

- Java Swing (included in modern JDKs).

- Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.

- Recommended to run via Visual Studio Code or NetBeans IDE.

## 🧠 Educational Purpose

- BingBong was developed as part of a Parallel Programming course project, focusing on:

- Thread management and synchronization.

- Real-time graphical simulation in Java Swing.

- Collision detection and physical modeling.
